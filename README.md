- 👋 Hi, I’m Gina. I’m building my skills in data analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certification, with experience in cybersecurity and real estate. Skilled in Excel, SQL, and R, I’m passionate about information technology and data analysis.
- 💼 Open to opportunities where I can make an impact with an awesome team!
- 👀 I’m interested in Information technology, data analysis, data security, network security administration, SQL, R, Tableau, Kaggle, RStudio, and learning!
- 🌱 Currently enrolled in the Data Analytics course, and graduated in May 2024 with an AAS Information Technology Cybersecurity. After graduating, I found most Cybersecurity positions are seeking 5-7 years of experience that I simply do not have.
